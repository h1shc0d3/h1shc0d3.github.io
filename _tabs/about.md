# Hello World !

I'm h1shc0d3, or at least that's one of my pseudonyms, which probably originated around 2015. It wasn't much in use until now. Today, I stand as a Software Engineer (SWE) working for a big tech company with an office in Poland. At 35, with a decade of commercial experience under my belt, I look back at my journey that started with a simple "Hello World" about 25 years ago.

This blog is a product of the advancements in AI, a tool that not only made its creation possible but also inspires its purpose. Here, I aim to create a sort of diary for myself - a place for learning and personal development. On the other hand, it's a platform that I hope will maintain my motivation and discipline. By being systematic, I believe this blog will help me reach the next stage in my career.

At this moment, my goals aren't sharply defined. I'm more in the process of developing a strategy rather than a concrete plan. The future is uncertain, a truth universally acknowledged, but that's the beauty of it. This blog will be a testament to my journey, a chronicle of growth and learning in the ever-evolving world of technology.

Stay tuned as I navigate through the complexities of tech, share insights from my decade-long experience, and explore the uncharted territories of AI and software development. Here's to the journey ahead â€“ may it be as enlightening as the past 25 years have been.

Until next time,
h1shc0d3
